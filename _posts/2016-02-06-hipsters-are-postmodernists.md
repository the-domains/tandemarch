Some believe that postmodernism as a movement was rooted in nostalgia. I disagree. Postmodernism started as an ironic movement, much like an ironic hipster mustache gains enough popular momentum to be propelled into main stream culture.
Feeling stifled by ultra constrained modernism, some artists and architects experimented with kitschy ionic columns and garish colors as a folly. The irony of designing warped Italianate structures after being trained to respect rational cleanliness must have been exhilarating for architects like Robert Venturi, who wrote "less is a bore" in response to Mies Van der Rohe's famous dictum "less is more." 

It turns out that being silly doesn't make for a lasting movement. Eventually, what was silly yesterday becomes today's norm. There's an unavoidable threshold where being ironic becomes simply being, and thus postmodernism was doomed.  So what's up with hipsters? 

I don't think there is such a thing. The guy that wears his pants so tight he has to walk next to his fixie isn't a hipster today. Sure, he was exciting ten years ago when all he talked about at parties was how you don't actually need brakes on a bike, or the special wax he found for his mustache. Today if you walk down \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (pick a street) you'll see a crowd of them doing mundane things like pumping gas for their SUV. Ten years ago, no self respecting hipster would drive a car, let alone a Chevy Suburban! 

The moment I could buy that airbrushed wolf shirt for my toddler at baby gap, the hipsters were doomed.
